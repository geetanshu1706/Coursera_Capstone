# Coursera_Capstone - NYC Battle of neighborhoods
## Busniess Problem
New York is one of the worst hit state by COVID-19 in USA. New York city was at the center of the disaster. The hospitals are already stretched thin with patients overflowing. According to [New York Times report](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/nyregion/new-york-city-coronavirus-cases.html), (at the moment of writing) death toll was 22795, case count topped 223,9677.

I was motivated by this to create something useful which would give some insight on this situation. In this project we are going to determine which neighborhood is best prepared for this pandemic, by finding out the best ratio of hospital beds per person for each neighborhood in this city.

*The report here should not be used as a measuring tool, because the situation has been changed a lot since Coronavirus COVID-19 has hit the city. And keeps changing day by day as some states are opening and some are closing back again. This report is intended to help people who are planning to move to New York during or after this pandemic to start their new lives ( school or jobs).*
